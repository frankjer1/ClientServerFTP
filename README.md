# ClientServerFTP
Example of a Client/Server FTP architecture and implementation using python3
To execute the scripts you must have python3 installed. The program has been tested with The 3.12 version.

The program has just two depenmdencies: "os" and "socket" . These should be already installed with python, but you can use pip to install them in case of any problem:

pip install os socket

You must execute the server script first, then the client one:

python FTPServer.py

python FTPClient.py
